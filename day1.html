   <h2> Q1.Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.</h2>
   <p>== and === operators in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables</p>
   <div class="diff">
        <div class="d1">
           <p>== compares the two variables,but it ignores the datatype of the variable</p>
           <p>it compares slower</p>
           <pre>
            var x="5";
            var y=5;
            if(x==y){
                return "hi";
            }
           </pre>
           <p>it prints hi</p>
        </div>
        <div class="d2">
            <p>=== compares the two variables and also compares the datatypes of the variables</p>
            <p>it works faster</p>
            <pre>
                var x="5";
                var y=5;
                if(x===y){
                    return "hi";
                }else{
                    return "sorry";
                }
            </pre>
            <p>it prints sorry,because x is a string and y is number.a difference in datatype</p>
        </div>
   </div>



   <h2>q2.What is the spread operator?</h2>
   <p>The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.</p>
            <pre>
                function sum(a,b,c) {
                    return a+b+c;
                  }
                  var numbers=[1,2,3];
                  console.log(sum(...numbers));
            </pre>



    <h2>q3.What are the differences between var, let and const?</h2>
    <div class="vlc">
        <div class="let">
            <p> let is a block scoped.</p>
            <p>var cannot be redeclared and can be modified later</p>
        </div>
        <div class="const">
            <p> const is a block scoped.</p>
            <p>var cannot be redeclared and cannot be modified later</p>
        </div>
        <div class="var">
            <p>var is a Global or Functional Scoped.</p>
            <p>var can be redeclared and can also be modified later</p>
        </div>
    </div>



    <h2>q4.What is execution context</h2>
    <p>The browser's JavaScript engine then creates a special environment to handle the transformation
        and execution of this JavaScript code. This environment is known as the Execution Context.</p>
    <p>Execution context is defined as the environment in which the JavaScript code is executed.</p>
    <p>By environment, I mean the value of this , variables, objects, and functions JavaScript code has access to at a particular time.</p>
    <p>There are two kinds of Execution Context in JavaScript:
        1. Global Execution Context (GEC)
        2. Function Execution Context (FEC)</p>


    

        <h2>q5.What is creation phase and execution phase?</h2>
       <p>
        Global execution context it is the first execution context that is created by js engine
        before any code is executed.(when the file first load in the browser)
       </p> 
       <p>
        it has 2 phases:
       </p>
        <div class="diff">
            <div class="d1">
                <h2>1)Creation phase:</h2>
                <p>
                    -this phase allows us to allocate memmory to all the variables but real value will not be assigned,
                    only value is assigned as 'undefined'
                </p>
               <pre>
                -example:
                  var a = undefined;
               </pre>
            </div>
            <div class="d2">
                <h2>2)Execution phase:</h2>
                <p>
                    -In this phase variables will get assigned to there real values and 
            the function will get executed when some one calls it.
                </p>
                <pre>
                -example:
                var a = 9;
                </pre>
            </div>
       </div>

       <h2>q6.What is meant by first class functions</h2>
    <p>A programming language is said to have First-class functions when functions in that 
        language are treated like any other variable.
    In such a language, </p>
        <p>1. a function can be passed as an argument to other functions, </p>
        <p>2. can be returned by another function</p>
        <p>3. can be assigned as a value to a variable.</p>
        <pre>
            const greetings = function() {
                console.log("good morning");
             }
             greetings();
        </pre>

        <h2>q7.What are closures?Give an example?</h2>
<p> A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
    It is the function having access to the parent scope,even after the parent function is closed.</p>
<pre>
    function global(){
        let a=10;
        function local(){
            console.log(a);
        }
        local()
    }
    global();
